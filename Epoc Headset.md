# Epoc Headset

## Background Information

  Saline solution is use for cleaning and creating connection on the headset. 
  
  Pads are designed to come apart and easily snap together
  * Plastic casing
  * Felt pad 
  * Metal Connector
      
  The metal connects will corrode due to the saline solution. 

  Emotiv suggest storing them separate from the Pads. 

## Charging
Headset takes about 4 hour to charge.

It is recommended if unused for several months to let charge for 24 hours. 

**DO NOT** charge Headset while wearing. 
 * This cause grounding issues
 * The headset will not connect with Bluetooth if charging


## Set Up
Heavily soak the Felt Pads in Saline Solution
* Suggested to do this inside the storage case
* This limits the mess

**DO NOT** add saline once attached to the headset
* This can cause damage to the headset

To attach to the headset, gentle turn pads Right until you hear a click, or they are flush with connections. 

* If they are loose, they fall out
	* This sometimes happens when adjusting the headset

**DO NOT** force the Pads into the headset
* This will break the thin plastic that hold the Pad in place

Note: One Pad is slightly broken for this reason, I had to spend extra time adjusting this Pad into the headset. I had no problem with the connection due to the damage. It just makes set up more difficult. 

## Adjusting Headset
### Wearing the Headset
Place on head like a crown

**DO NOT** pull apart, slide down the head

The Front sensors should sit about three fingers above your eyebrows
 
### Adjusting the Sensors
Adjusting the Sensors will take the longest of the entire set up

Sensors need to be in close contact with the scape
* If you have long hair, this will be tricky
In the beginning it takes about 30 minutes, I was able to bet it down to 10 minutes with practice

Just be patient 

Here’s how I made it a little less painful

1. The first senor(s) I adjusted was the, which is right behind the ear. 
	* These sensors should be on the bone, directly behind the ear
	* In my opinion, this is the most painful sensor, as the plastic often bushed against my ear and the pressure caused headaches over time.
 
2. The next senor(s) was the hidden in the band, located above the ear
	* This sensor I found was the most important sensor, and if it has improper connection, the rest of the sensor will have trouble registering 
 
3. Then adjust the reference sensor(s), located above and behind the ear.
	* Make sure sensor has good contact with the scalp
* Press and Hold the Reference Senor(s) for about 5-10 seconds 
	* The other sensor should light up one of three colors, red, yellow, green. 
 
4. The order of fixing the other sensors are not as important
	* Remember to adjust them and your hair to maintain good connection

Gently pressing each sensor often improved the connection.
* If the connect is not turning green after a few presses, try readjusting the sensors to have better connection to the scalp.
* If a sensor loses connection (after registering green), you do not have to readjust, just gently press the senor and connection should be established. 
 
Lose Sensor will often fall out during this readjusting period. Sadly, I recommend taking the entire headset off, reattaching the sensor, and starting the whole adjustment process over again. 

Note:
There is a sensor behind the band, not shown in the Emotiv pictures. I often forgot about this senor when adjusting my headset 
 
 
At minimum, try to only have one sensor yellow and the rest green. 
* Depending on the day, I’ll have trouble with one particular sensors.
	* Don’t sweat it. 


Once the Headset is connected you can start brain Training on the Emotiv Applications

Have Fun.
