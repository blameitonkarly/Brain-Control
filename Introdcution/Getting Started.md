# Getting Started

To use the Emotiv Epoc and training Applications you have to first make an account with Emotiv.

Once you have an account you can "Buy" the EmotiVBCI. This is a free software so I use the turm Buy loosely. 

After "Buy" the software. You can download the the Emoitiv Installer, which give you the EmoticBCI, EmotivPRO (Lite) and a 7 day free trial of BrainViz. 

You do not have to download all the applications at once, every time your computer starts up the Emotiv APP will start up and give you the option to download/update any apps

  EmotivBCI is the application you can use to train. 
  
  EmotivPRO (Lite) allows you to view the individual EEG waves. If you buy the PRO version, you can record unlimited. For my purposes paying for this software was unnecessary.
  
  BrainViz showed the active areas of the brain, and allowed you to view the different types of waves 
      (I didn't think this software worked very well, and didn't feel the need to pay for a longer use of it)
